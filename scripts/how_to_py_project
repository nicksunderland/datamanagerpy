- requirements 
--- python & pip installed on the computer 
--- the python package 'virtualenv' installed (pip install virtualenv)
- create a project directory
- create an R project there
- create a python virtual environment in the directory 
--- in commandline cd into the project directory and run 'virtualenv my_env'
--- activate the environment with 'source my_env/bin/activate'
--- check the python version / path with 'which python'
- installing python packages to the virtul environment
--- e.g. 'pip install numpy pandas matplotlib' (within the directory)
--- or in the R session use 'py_install("pandas")'
- in RStudio/R install the 'reticulate' package 
--- install.packages("reticulate")
- in the project directory create a file called '.Renviron'
--- tell the project to use our virtual environment's python with 'RETICULATE_PYTHON=my_env/bin/python'
--- restart R session and check config with 'reticulate::py_config()'
--- this is just a cleaner way of doing 'use_virtualenv()' o 'use_python()'
- creating an R package that uses python modules and using github_actions
